# Assignments Repository
This repository contains a series of programming assignments covering various topics. Each assignment is focused on a specific concept or task. Below is an overview of each assignment along with a brief description of the tasks involved.

## Assignment 1 - Classes and Strings
### Overview
This assignment involves the function declaration in a class named `Point3D` and string declaration.

## Assignment 2: Character Functions
### Overview
This project includes a C++ function that returns a `std::string` with a message.

## Assignment 3: File Handling in C++ Part1
### Overview
File handling in C++ to read and process triangle data from a file. Implementation split between `Reader.cpp` and `Writer.cpp`. Tasks include using `getline()`, utilizing `istringstream` for string parsing, creating `Point3D` objects, and populating a vector of `Triangle` objects.

## Assignment 4: File Handling in C++ Part2
### Overview
File handling in C++ to read and process triangle data from a file. Implementation split between `Reader.cpp` and `Writer.cpp`. Tasks include using `getline()`, utilizing `istringstream` for string parsing, creating `Point3D` objects, and populating a vector of `Triangle` objects, and reading only vertex value from `.stl` file.

## Assignment 5: Implementation of Lambda Function
### Overview
A lambda expression named `printMsgFileNotFound` implemented in `Reader.cpp` to provide a message indicating that the file was not found.

## Assignment 6: Implementation of Lambda Function with capture clause and mutable.
### Overview
A lambda expression named `printMsgFileNotFound` implemented in `Reader.cpp` with a capture clause and `mutable` keyword. The purpose is to provide a message indicating that the file was not found.

## Assignment 7: Generalized capture with initialization.
### Overview
A lambda expression named `printMsgFileNotFound` implemented in `Reader.cpp` with generalized capture with initialization. The purpose is to provide a message indicating that the file was not found.

## Assignment 8 - Implementation of Iterators.
### Overview
Focuses on utilizing iterators to print vertex points on the console. The task involves defining an iterator type for a vector of triangles and subsequently iterating through the vector to display the vertex coordinates.

## Assignment 9 - Implementation of sequential containers List, Vector, Deque part1.
### Overview
Involves the use of sequential containers such as list, vector, and deque.

## Assignment 10 - Implementation of sequential container Deque Part2.
### Overview
Involves the use of sequential container deque and string concatenation.

## Assignment 11 - Use of `std::map`
### Overview
Uses `std::map` container in C++ STL to store a pair of `<Triangle, double>` where `Triangle` is an object of class `Triangle` referenced from the `mtriangles` vector of triangulation, and `double` is the perimeter of the triangle.

## Assignment 12: Implementation of virtual function.
### Overview
Implements multi-level inheritance with a virtual function.

## Assignment 13 - Interfacing to C
### Overview
Optimizes program speed by implementing a crucial part in C, applicable to various languages with different keywords/methods. The goal is to enhance performance by treating a code segment directly as C.
