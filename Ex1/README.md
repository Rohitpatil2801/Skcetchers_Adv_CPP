# Assignment 1 - Classes and Strings
 
## Overview
This assignment involves the function declaration in a class named `Point3D` and `string` declaration.
## Implementation Steps
 
1. **Declared class `Point3D` in `/Ex1/headers/Point3D.h` and defination in `/Ex1/src/Point3D.cpp`**.
 
2. **Writen a `constructor` for `Point3D` that takes three double variables as arguments and initializes member variables with the provided argument values**.
 
3. **Added member functions `getters` to the class to display the member variables of the class.Example: `x()` displays the x value of the `Point3D` object**.

4. **Declarared a `string` in `/Ex1/src/Reader.cpp` and assigned a value `"File not exists"`**.
 
4. **Written test Program in `/Ex1/src/Plane.cpp`**.
