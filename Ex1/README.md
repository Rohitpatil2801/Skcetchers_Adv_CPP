# Assignment 1 - Classes and Strings
 
## Overview
This assignment involves the function declaration in a class named `Point3D` and `string` declaration.
## Implementation Steps
 
1. **Class File:**
   - Class Declaration: `/Ex1/headers/Point3D.h`
   - Class Defination: `/Ex1/src/Point3D.cpp`
 
2. **Constructor:**
   - Writen a constructor for `Point3D` that takes three double variables as arguments.
   - Initializes member variables with the provided argument values.
 
3. **Getters:**
   - Added member functions (getters) to the class to display the member variables of the class.
   - Example: `x()` displays the x value of the `Point3D` object.

4. **String Declaration:**
   - Declarared a `string` in `/Ex1/src/Reader.cpp`
   - Assigned a value `"File not exists"`.
 
4. **Test Program File:**
   - Test Program: `/Ex1/src/Plane.cpp`
