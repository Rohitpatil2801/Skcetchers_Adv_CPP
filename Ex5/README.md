# Assignment 5: Implementation of Lambda Function

## Overview

In this assignment, a lambda expression named `printMsgFileNotFound` has been implemented in the `Reader.cpp` file. The purpose of this lambda expression is to provide a message indicating that the file was not found.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Implemented a lambda expression in `getTriangles()` function in location `/Ex5/src/Reader.cpp`**.
 
   ```cpp
   auto printMsgFileNotFound = []() {
       std::string msg = "File not found";
       return msg;
   };

2. **This expression returns a `std::string` to print `File not found` on the console**.
